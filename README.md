## Problem statement: Traditional crime reporting systems often lack interactivity and accessibility, limiting the public’s ability to report incidents in real-time. This delays law enforcement response and hinders proactive crime prevention efforts.


## Idea:

● Develop an interactive map-based application that enables citizens to report crimes and
incidents in real-time.
● Allow users to view crime data on an interactive map, helping communities stay informed
about local safety concerns.
● Provide law enforcement agencies with valuable data to enhance proactive crime
prevention measures.
● Implement real-time notifications to update users on ongoing investigations and crime
trends.
● Foster seamless communication between citizens and law enforcement to improve
public safety and community engagement.
